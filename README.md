# About

This is a microservices chassis for building applications with JEE8/MicroProfile/Docker, based on Thorntail.
Datasource and database-specific migration scripts can be selected by specifying a configuration profile.
Unit-integration tests are ran against an H2 in-memory database.

Checkout version `thorntail-2.2.1` for a fully tested version, https has not been tested for this version yet.

# Building the application

Build the application with

    $ mvn package
    
or

    $ mvn package -Pdocker
    
to build Docker images as well. By default, the `h2` profile is activated to include the H2 in-memory
database driver.

Note that the [`thorntail-hollow`](thorntail-hollow) module
defines base images that need to build once. Afterwards, you can build Docker images from
the [`myapp`](myapp) directory as well.

# Running the application

Go to directory [`myapp`](myapp). To run the application from Maven:

    $ mvn thorntail:run
    
To run from the command line:

    $ java -jar target/myapp-thorntail.jar -Sh2
    
The '-Sh2' option configures a H2 datasource. When using a different database, make sure to enable
the profile for including a matching database driver during the build phase.

## Running from Docker

Make sure that you have built the base image for the application.

To run the application in Docker from Maven:

    $ mvn docker:run -Pdocker,h2
    
To run the application in Docker from the command-line:

    $ mvn package -Pdocker,h2
    $ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 caspard/myapp -Sh2
 
## Running from the IDE

To run the application from IntelliJ:
- Edit Run/Debug Configurations
- Add Application configuration
- Set Main class: `org.wildfly.swarm.runner.Runner`
- Set Program arguments: `-Sh2 -Sdebug`
- Set Working directory: `$MODULE_WORKING_DIR$`
- Set Use classpath of module: "myapp"
- Check Include dependecies with "Provided" scope

# Testing the application

## Running Arquillian unit-integration tests

The `@DefaultDeployment` annotation does not bundle tests dependencies for in-container tests.
Therefore, an Arquillian loadable extension is added via the Java SPI mechanism for adding test
dependencies to the deployment. 

Note that `@DefaultDeployment` only adds classes in the current package. Place your tests in
a package that includes all dependencies.

The file [`project-stages.yml`](myapp/src/test/resources/project-stages.yml) contains configuration
required for testing, in particular an H2 datasource. In Thorntail 4, this file may be removed
and replaced with profiles that are activated through the `thorntail.profiles` property.

## Running Arquillian tests from the IDE

To run Arquillian integration tests from IntelliJ:
- Edit Run/Debug Configurations
- Add Arquillian Junit configuration
- Select Configure
- Add Manual container configuration
- Set name: "Thorntail 2.5.0"
- Add dependency, select Existing library: "Maven: io.thorntail:arquillian-adapter:2.5.0-Final"

# Application profiles

## HTTPS

Enable https by specifying the `https` profile:

    $ java -jar target/myapp-thorntail.jar -Sh2 -Shttps
    
See [project-https.yml](myapp/src/main/resources/project-https.yml) for an example https configuration
(adapt to your needs). Https is not configured by default, because storing passwords and certificates
in archives/containers is insecure and not portable across environments. Furthermore, https could be 
offloaded by Nginx, or Istio when deploying to Kubernetes.

To generate a self-signed certificate, run `gen_keystore.sh` in [myapp/security](myapp/security).

To run the Docker container with https enabled, mount a host volume containing `keystore.jsk` at
 `/opt/security` and specify `-Shttps` as command-line argument. The `mvn docker:run -Pdocker`
target is configured for running with https enabled.

## Datasources

Datasource configuration is stored in `profile-\<db\>.yml` files. These profiles are not enabled by default. In this way,
it is possible to run a standalone application with an H2 in-memory database, or connect to a network database.
A datasource configuration must be supplied in order to run the application, either via a profile or via
external configuration file. Available profiles are: `h2`, `oracle`, `mysql` (untested), `postgres` (untested).
 
## Debugging

The `debug` profile enables debug logging.

# Docker

## Java 8 in Docker

The Fabric8.io `run-java.sh` script is used for tuning JVM options and running the application in Docker.
This allows many JVM settings to be configured via environment variables.
See [https://github.com/fabric8io-images/run-java-sh/blob/master/fish-pepper/run-java-sh/readme.md](https://github.com/fabric8io-images/run-java-sh/blob/master/fish-pepper/run-java-sh/readme.md)
for configuration options.

When building the container, an exec-style entrypoint should be specified, in order to launch a single process
that can receive Unix signals. In this way, command line arguments for profiles can be specified when starting
the container. To run the image with another entrypoint:

    $ docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash caspard/myapp

## Remote debugging in Docker

The `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable can be specified to set Java command line options without
altering the container image. To enable remote debugging in a Docker container, 
start the container with the following environment variable:

    JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005

The `mvn docker:run -Pdocker` target has been configured for this (see [`pom.xml`](thorntail-parent/pom.xml)).

# Oracle database

## Install OJDBC driver

Download `ojdbc8.jar` from
[https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-ucp-183-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-ucp-183-downloads.html)
and install it in your local Maven repository:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=ojdbc8.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle.jdbc -DartifactId=ojdbc10 -Dversion=18.3.0.0 -Dpackaging=jar

## Configure the database connection

Configure the connection details in [project-oracle.yml](myapp/src/main/resources/project-oracle.yml).
Also configure the JDBC URL in [myapp/om.xml](myapp/pom.xml). See the Thorntail documentation
for all configuration options.

## Running the application

To run the application from the command line with an Oracle database:

    $ mvn package -Poracle,\!h2
    $ java -jar target/myapp-thorntail.jar -Soracle
    
## Running from Docker

The `docker` profile in [pom.xml](myapp/pom.xml) overrides the JDBC connection URL
for service discovery in a Docker network (adapt to your needs).

To run the application from Docker with an Oracle database:

    $ mvn  package -Pdocker,oracle,\!h2
    $ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 myapp -Soracle

## Flyway Maven plugin

It is also possible to test database migrations via the Flyway Maven plugin. 

Apply migrations:

    $ mvn flyway:migrate@myschema -Poracle

Clean database:

    $ mvn flyway:clean@myschema -Poracle

# Docker Compose example

The directory [docker-compose](docker-compose) contains a Docker Compose configuration to run a containerized application 
and Oracle database.

## Prerequisites

First build an Oracle container image as described in [https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance). 
For Oracle Database 12.2.0.1 Enterprise Edition this involves the following steps:

1. Place `linuxx64_12201_database.zip` in `dockerfiles/12.2.0.1`.
2. Go to `dockerfiles` and run `buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.0.1 -e`

## Build the application

Go to directory [`myapp`](myapp). To build the application as follows:
 
     $ mvn package -Pdocker,oracle,\!h2

## Build the database

Go to the directory [`docker-compose`](docker-compose). First start the database container:

    $ docker-compose up -d oracledb
    $ docker-compose logs -f oracledb

Follow the log file and wait for the database to build. Then start the application container:

    $ docker-compose up -d
    $ docker-compose logs -f myapp
